# Introduction to Modern Data Engineering with Snowflake
## Module 3
### Data Transformations
- raw data won't have the insights we are looking for
- before extracting insights we must transform data to an end state usable for analytics
- data transformations are formed against the raw data to get closer to our desired insights
- common data transformations:
  - address missing / incorrect data
  - fix formatting
  - aggregations
  - derived columns
  - derived tables / views
- most common methods of data transformations in Snowflake:
  - SQL
  - Snowpark
- write functions / logic invoked to aid transformations at scale
  - user defined functions
  - stored procedures
- streams offer efficient transformations
- dynamic tables offer automatic transformations
